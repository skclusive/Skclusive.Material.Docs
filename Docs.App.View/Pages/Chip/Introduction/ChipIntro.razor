# Chips

<p class=""description"">Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action.</p>

[Chips](https://material.io/design/components/chips.html) allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

While included here as a standalone component, the most common use will
be in some form of input, so some of the behaviour demonstrated here is
not shown in context.
