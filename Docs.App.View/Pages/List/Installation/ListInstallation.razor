if you want to use List alone follow the standalone installation. otherwise to use all components, [compound installation](./installation) can be followed.

You can [install List package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skclusive.Material.List/) by typing the below command in your terminal:

```csharp
dotnet add package Skclusive.Material.List
