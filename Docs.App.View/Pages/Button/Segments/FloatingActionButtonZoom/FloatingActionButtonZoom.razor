The floating action button animates onto the screen as an expanding piece of material, by default.

A floating action button that spans multiple lateral screens (such as tabbed screens) should briefly disappear,
then reappear if its action changes.

The Zoom transition can be used to achieve this. Note that since both the exiting and entering
animations are triggered at the same time, we use `enterDelay` to allow the outgoing Floating Action Button's
animation to finish before the new one enters.
