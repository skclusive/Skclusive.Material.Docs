## Limitations

### Shrink

The input label ""shrink"" state isn't always correct.
The input label is supposed to shrink as soon as the input is displaying something.
In some circumstances, we can't determine the ""shrink"" state (number input, datetime input, Stripe input). You might notice an overlap.

![shrink](./_content/Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View/images/text-fields/shrink.png)

To workaround the issue, you can force the ""shrink"" state of the label.
```html
<TextField InputLabelProps={{ shrink: true }} />
```
or
```html
<StandardInputLabel Shrink>Count</InputLabel>
```

### Floating label

The floating label is absolutely positioned, it won't impact the layout of the page.
You need to make sure that the input is larger than the label to display correctly.

## Accessibility

In order for the text field to be accessible, **the input should be linked to the label and the helper text**. The underlying DOM nodes should have this structure.

```html
<div
    class=""form-control"">
    <label
        for=""my-input"">
        Email address
    </label>
    <input
        id=""my-input""
        aria-describedby=""my-helper-text"" />
    <span
        id=""my-helper-text"">
        We'll never share your email.
    </span>
</div>
```

- If you are using the `TextField` component, you just have to provide a unique `id`.
- If you are composing the component:

```html
<FormControl>
    <StandardInputLabel
        For=""my-input"">
        Email address
    </InputLabel>
    <StandardInput
        Id=""my-input""
        aria-describedby=""my-helper-text"" />
    <FormHelperText
        Id=""my-helper-text"">
        We'll never share your email.
    </FormHelperText>
</FormControl>
```

")" />
