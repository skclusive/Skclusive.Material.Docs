# Typography

<p class=""description"">Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.</p>

Too many type sizes and styles at once can spoil any layout.
A [typographic scale](https://material.io/design/typography/#type-scale) has a limited set of type sizes that work well together along with the layout grid.

## General

The *Roboto* font will **not** be automatically loaded by Material-UI.
The developer is responsible for loading all fonts used in their application.
Roboto Font has a few easy ways to get started. For more advanced configuration, check out
[the theme customization section](/customization/typography/).

## Roboto Font CDN

Shown below is a sample link markup used to load the Roboto font from a CDN:

```html
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"" />
```

For more info check out the [typeface](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces/tree/master/packages/roboto) project.

⚠️ Be careful when using this approach.
Make sure your bundler doesn't eager load all the font variations (100/300/400/500/700/900, italic/regular, SVG/woff).
Inlining all the font files can significantly increase the size of your bundle.
Material-UI default typography configuration only relies on 300, 400, 500, and 700 font weights.
