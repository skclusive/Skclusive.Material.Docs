if you want to use Grid alone follow the standalone installation. otherwise to use all components, [compound installation](./installation) can be followed.

You can [install Grid package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skclusive.Material.Grid/) by typing the below command in your terminal:

```csharp
dotnet add package Skclusive.Material.Grid
```

Then, you can import it in your `_Imports.razor`.

```csharp
@using Skclusive.Material.Grid
```

<ThemeProvider>
    <Router AppAssembly=""@typeof(Program).Assembly"">

</ThemeProvider>
```
