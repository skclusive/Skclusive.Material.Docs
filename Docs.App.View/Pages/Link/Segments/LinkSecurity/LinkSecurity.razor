## Security

When you use `target=""_blank""` with Links, it is [recommended](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/noopener) to always set `rel=""noopener""` or `rel=""noreferrer""` when linking to third party content.

- `rel=""noopener""` prevents the new page from being able to access the `window.opener` property and ensures it runs in a separate process.
  Without this, the target page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL.
- `rel=""noreferrer""` has the same effect, but also prevents the _Referer_ header from being sent to the new page.
  ⚠️ Removing the referrer header will affect analytics.
