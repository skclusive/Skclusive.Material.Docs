# Modal

<p class=""description"">The modal component provides a solid foundation for creating dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, or whatever else.</p>

The component renders its `children` node in front of a backdrop component.
The `Modal` offers important features:

- 💄 Manages modal stacking when one-at-a-time just isn't enough.
- 🔐 Creates a backdrop, for disabling interaction below the modal.
- 🔐 It disables scrolling of the page content while open.
- ♿️ It properly manages focus; moving to the modal content,
  and keeping it there until the modal is closed.
- ♿️ Adds the appropriate ARIA roles automatically.
- 📦 [5 kB gzipped](/size-snapshot).

> **Terminology note**. The term ""modal"" is sometimes used to mean ""dialog"", but this is a misnomer.
A modal window describes parts of a UI.
An element is considered modal if [it blocks interaction with the rest of the application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window).

If you are creating a modal dialog, you probably want to use the [Dialog](/components/dialogs/) component rather than directly using Modal.
Modal is a lower-level construct that is leveraged by the following components:

- [Dialog](/components/dialogs/)
- [Drawer](/components/drawers/)
- [Menu](/components/menus/)
- [Popover](/components/popover/)

## Simple modal

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.SimpleModal, Skclusive.Material.Docs""}}

Notice that you can disable the outline (often blue or gold) with the `outline: 0` CSS property.

## Transitions

The open/close state of the modal can be animated with a transition component.
This component should respect the following conditions:

- Be a direct child descendent of the modal.
- Have an `in` prop. This corresponds to the open / close state.
- Call the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts.
- Call the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed.
These two callbacks allow the modal to unmount the child content when closed and fully transitioned.

Modal has built-in support for [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group).

## Server-side modal

In order to display the modal in server rendering, you need to disable the portal feature with the `disablePortal` prop:

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.ServerModal, Skclusive.Material.Docs""}}

## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal)

- Be sure to add `aria-labelledby=""id...""`, referencing the modal title, to the `Modal`.
Additionally, you may give a description of your modal with the `aria-describedby=""id...""` prop on the `Modal`.
```jsx
<Modal
  aria-labelledby=""modal-title""
  aria-describedby=""modal-description"">
  <h2 id=""modal-title"">
    My Title
  </h2>
  <p id=""modal-description"">
    My Description
  </p>
</Modal>
```
- The [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) can help you set the initial focus on the most relevant element, based on your modal content.
- A modal window overlys on either the primary window or another modal window. Windows under a modal are **inert**. That is, users cannot interact with content outside an active modal window.
